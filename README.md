## **Types of algorithms implemented:**
- Arrays
- Graphs

### Arrays:
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Heap Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

### Graphs:
- Topological Sort using DFS
- Topological Sort using BFS

## Features:
- This program is portable as it works on Windows, Mac and Linux systems.
- This program is very interactive.
- We can visualize several sorting algorithms.
- This program is user friendly and the user can learn about different sorting algorithms.
- The program gives us an option to use previously entered array or graph. This is very helpful and saves time for the user.

## Data Structures used:
- Array
- 2D Array
- Heap
- Stack
- Queue
- Graph

### Manual:
- Type "mingw32-make -f make.mk" in the terminal after navigating to the directory where the files are stored.
- Type ./a.exe to execute the program.
